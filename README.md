Procedural GIS renderer. Maybe a general game engine if I make good architecture decisions.
I have written so many basic 3D renderers so I'm going a different direction with this one.

### Project goals

All good side projects teach you something. I have never done anything on this list before.
The goal is to get through this list without the engine becoming an unmaintainable mess.

- [x] Async logging
- [x] Parse (and render) FBX
- [X] Parse OpenStreetMap data
  - [x] Parse protocol buffers
  - [X] Assemble nodes into roads
  - [X] Store auxiliary information

- [X] Interactive GUIs
- [X] Parse raw elevation data
  - [ ] Optimize elevation file size

- [ ] Final file format

    - [ ] Performance improvements
- [ ] Render North Carolina
- [ ] Vulkan backend?
- [ ] Raytracing???

### Data sources

- .osm.pbf files can be downloaded or generated from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
- .tif files can (apparently) be generated by GIS software. I get mine from [the state of North Carolina](https://sdd.nc.gov/).

Additionally, the project has a code dependency on [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/).
